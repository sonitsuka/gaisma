    The .video-contents element would contain the HTML for the video contents, such as the title, description, and duration. When the user hovers over the thumbnail, the JavaScript code would dynamically insert the contents of the .video-contents element into the page.

You can also use JavaScript to play the video when the user hovers over the thumbnail. To do this, you would need to get the YouTube video ID from the thumbnail's src attribute, and then use the ytplayer.loadVideoById() method to load the video. For example, the following code would play the video when the user hovers over the thumbnail:

The data-video-id attribute would contain the YouTube video ID, and the YT.Player object would be used to play the video. When the user hovers over the thumbnail, the JavaScript code would load the video and start playing it.
